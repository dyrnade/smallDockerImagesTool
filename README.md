# smallDockerImagesTool
Smaller Docker Images Tool with the power of Nix Package Manager.

### This project is intended to have simpler usage of Nix language for new comers like me. ###

Important: Indentation is important so Please! follow the rules.

Note: I am new at Haskell and Nix, so please let me know about any improvements.
      The code looks awful somehow to follow error free indentation as possible as it can and some Nix language syntax.
